RAG_Sample
This repository contains a sample implementation demonstrating the principles of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based models and generative models to produce more accurate, relevant, and factual responses, especially in domains requiring up-to-date or specific knowledge not inherently contained within the generative model's training data.

Introduction
Traditional large language models (LLMs) can sometimes "hallucinate" or provide outdated information. RAG addresses this by first retrieving relevant documents or information from a knowledge base and then using that retrieved context to inform the generation of the response. This sample provides a basic framework to understand and experiment with this concept.

Features
Document Indexing: A simple mechanism to index a collection of text documents.

Retrieval Component: Uses a basic search (e.g., keyword or vector similarity) to find relevant document snippets.

Augmented Generation: Integrates the retrieved context with a large language model (simulated or actual API call) to generate a more informed answer.

Modular Design: Components are separated for easy understanding and modification.

How RAG Works
The RAG process typically involves two main phases:

Retrieval Phase:

When a query is received, a retrieval model searches a vast knowledge base (e.g., a database of documents, articles, or web pages) for information relevant to the query.

This often involves converting documents and queries into numerical representations (embeddings) and finding documents with similar embeddings.

The top-K most relevant documents or passages are then selected.

Generation Phase:

The retrieved documents/passages are provided as additional context to a generative language model (e.g., a transformer-based LLM).

The LLM then uses both the original query and the retrieved context to formulate a comprehensive, accurate, and relevant answer. This significantly reduces the likelihood of hallucinations and ensures the generated content is grounded in factual information.

Setup
To set up and run this sample, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/RAG_Sample.git
cd RAG_Sample

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: requirements.txt should contain libraries like transformers, faiss-cpu or scikit-learn for embeddings/similarity, and potentially torch or tensorflow if using deep learning models for embeddings.)

Prepare your knowledge base:
Place your text documents (e.g., .txt files) in the data/documents/ directory. Each file will be treated as a separate document for indexing.

Usage
1. Index Documents
First, you need to index your documents to create a searchable knowledge base.

python main.py --action index

This script will process the documents in data/documents/, create embeddings (if applicable), and save the index to data/index/.

2. Query the RAG System
Once the documents are indexed, you can query the RAG system:

python main.py --action query --query "What is the capital of France?"

Replace "What is the capital of France?" with your desired query. The system will retrieve relevant information and generate a response.

Example Code Snippet (Conceptual)
# main.py (simplified conceptual flow)

from rag_components import DocumentLoader, Retriever, Generator

def main(action, query=None):
    if action == "index":
        documents = DocumentLoader.load_documents("data/documents/")
        Retriever.build_index(documents, "data/index/")
        print("Documents indexed successfully.")
    elif action == "query":
        if not query:
            print("Please provide a query for the 'query' action.")
            return

        Retriever.load_index("data/index/")
        retrieved_context = Retriever.retrieve(query)

        # In a real scenario, this would be an API call to an LLM
        # For this sample, we might simulate or use a local small model
        response = Generator.generate_answer(query, retrieved_context)
        print(f"Query: {query}")
        print(f"Retrieved Context:\n{retrieved_context}")
        print(f"Generated Answer: {response}")
    else:
        print("Invalid action. Use 'index' or 'query'.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import argparse
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="RAG Sample System")
    parser.add_argument("--action", required=True, help="Action to perform: 'index' or 'query'")
    parser.add_argument("--query", help="Query string for the 'query' action")
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args.action, args.query)
