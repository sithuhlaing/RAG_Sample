A virus is a microscopic infectious agent that can only replicate inside the living cells of an organism. Here's a concise summary:
ðŸ”¬ What is a Virus?

    Non-living outside a host: Viruses are not considered alive because they cannot reproduce or carry out metabolism on their own.

    Living inside a host: Once inside a host cell, they hijack the cell's machinery to produce more viruses.

ðŸ§¬ Structure

    Genetic Material: Either DNA or RNA (never both).

    Protein Coat (Capsid): Protects the genetic material.

    Envelope (in some viruses): A lipid membrane derived from the host cell, present in viruses like influenza and HIV.

ðŸ¦  How Viruses Infect

    Attachment: Virus binds to a specific receptor on a host cell.

    Entry: It injects or enters its genetic material.

    Replication: Uses the host's machinery to make viral components.

    Assembly: New viruses are assembled.

    Release: New viruses leave the cell, often destroying it.

ðŸ“‹ Types of Viruses

    Animal viruses: e.g., Influenza, HIV, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)

    Plant viruses: e.g., Tobacco mosaic virus

    Bacteriophages: Viruses that infect bacteria

ðŸ’‰ Prevention & Treatment

    Vaccines: Stimulate immunity (e.g., for measles, polio, COVID-19).

    Antiviral drugs: Inhibit viral replication (e.g., for HIV, herpes).

    Hygiene: Handwashing and masks reduce spread.

ðŸ“š Fun Fact

Viruses are the most numerous biological entities on Earth, outnumbering all life forms.

Would you like a more detailed explanation of a specific virus or category?

Viruses can be classified in several ways, but broadly, they fall into seven main types based on their genetic material and replication methods according to the Baltimore classification system. This is the most widely accepted method for categorizing viruses.
ðŸ§¬ 7 Types of Viruses (Baltimore Classification)
Type	Genetic Material	Example Viruses	Notes
Type I	Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)	Herpesvirus, Adenovirus, Smallpox	Replicates like host DNA.
Type II	Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)	Parvovirus	Must convert to dsDNA before replication.
Type III	Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)	Rotavirus	Requires a special enzyme to transcribe RNA.
Type IV	Single-stranded RNA (+ sense)	Poliovirus, Dengue, SARS-CoV-2	Acts directly as mRNA.
Type V	Single-stranded RNA (âˆ’ sense)	Influenza, Rabies, Ebola	Must be transcribed to +RNA first.
Type VI	RNA reverse-transcribing viruses	HIV (retrovirus)	Uses reverse transcriptase to make DNA from RNA.
Type VII	DNA reverse-transcribing viruses	Hepatitis B virus	dsDNA uses RNA intermediate for replication.
ðŸ§ª Other Classification Methods

Besides genetic material, viruses are also classified by:

    Shape: Helical, icosahedral, complex

    Envelope: Enveloped vs. non-enveloped

    Host type: Animal, plant, bacterial (bacteriophages), fungal, etc.
